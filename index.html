          <p class="lead">The Sultanate of Oman or just Oman is located in the southeast of the Asian continent, specifically in the Middle East, and Oman is one of the Arab Gulf countries. The official language in Oman is Arabic, but due to external openness and multiculturalism, most Omanis speak other foreign languages ​​fluently in addition to Arabic such as French, German, Urdu, Farsi, and especially English as it is an international language of communication. The national currency is the Omani Rial and is symbolized by OMR. Oman is characterized by a hot and dry climate throughout the year, except for the winter, when some rain falls،The system of government in the Sultanate is a hereditary sultan, and the ruler is called the Sultan. Sultan Haitham bin Tariq Al Said is the current sultan of the Sultanate of Oman.The flag of the Sultanate consists of three colors, red, white and green, and contains the state emblem, which is two swords and an Omani dagger،Due to the vast area of ​​the Sultanate, which amounts to 309,501 km², the Sultanate was divided into 11 governorates for each governorate, and a governor follows the Sultan. The governorate of Muscat is the capital of Oman. </p>
